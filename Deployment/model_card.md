# Stock AI Predictor Model Card

## Model Details

### Parameter Tester Model
- **Model Type**: Parameter optimization framework for pattern mining and clustering
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Architecture**: Custom pattern recognition with clustering algorithms
- **Training Data**: Historical price patterns with performance metrics

### Reinforcement Learning Trading Model
- **Model Type**: Policy Gradient (PPO)
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Architecture**: MLP Policy neural network
- **Training Data**: Historical price patterns, sentiment data, and trading performance

## Intended Use
- Asset price prediction
- Trading signal generation
- Portfolio optimization
- Risk management

## Limitations
- Market performance is subject to unpredictable events
- Past performance doesn't guarantee future results
- Models should be regularly retrained on recent data

## Performance Metrics
- Win Rate
- Profit Factor
- Sharpe Ratio
- Maximum Drawdown
- Return on Investment

## Training Procedure
- Parameter Tester: Grid search over different parameter combinations
- RL Model: PPO algorithm with custom reward function based on trading performance

## Ethical Considerations
- Models should be used as decision support tools, not as sole decision makers
- Users should be aware of financial risks associated with algorithmic trading

## Caveats and Recommendations
- Always use stop losses and position sizing appropriate for your risk tolerance
- Regularly evaluate model performance on out-of-sample data
- Consider market regime changes that may affect model performance
