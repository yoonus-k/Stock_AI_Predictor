# MLflowManager Documentation Updates

The following are suggested updates to the method documentation in the `MLflowManager` class to better reflect the enhanced model type system:

## 1. `find_latest_model` method

```python
def find_latest_model(self, model_type: str = "base", version_type: str = "latest") -> Tuple[str, str]:
    """
    Find the latest model of specified type using standardized tagging system
    
    Args:
        model_type: Type of model to find (e.g. 'base', 'continued', 'curriculum', etc.)
        version_type: Version type to find ('latest' or 'old')
        
    Returns:
        Tuple of (run_id, model_path) or (None, None) if not found
    """
```

## 2. `find_best_model` method

```python
def find_best_model(self, 
                  model_type: str = "base", 
                  metric: str = "evaluation/best_mean_reward",
                  min_timesteps: int = 0) -> Tuple[str, str]:
    """
    Find the best performing model of specified type based on a metric
    
    Args:
        model_type: Type of model to find (e.g. 'base', 'continued', 'curriculum', etc.)
        metric: Metric to use for finding the best model
        min_timesteps: Minimum number of timesteps the model should have been trained for
        
    Returns:
        Tuple of (run_id, model_path) or (None, None) if not found
    """
```

## 3. `log_enhancement_metrics` method

```python
def log_enhancement_metrics(self, base_run_id: str):
    """
    Log enhancement metrics comparing to a previous model run
    
    This method calculates and logs improvement metrics between the current model
    and a previous model (which can be of any type: base, continued, etc.).
    It allows tracking improvements across multiple enhancement iterations.
    
    Args:
        base_run_id: ID of the previous model run to compare against
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary of improvement metrics
    """
```

## 4. `register_model_version` method

```python
def register_model_version(self, 
                          model_path: str, 
                          model_name: str = None,
                          base_run_id: str = None,
                          stage: str = "Staging",
                          tags: Dict[str, str] = None) -> str:
    """
    Register a model in the MLflow Model Registry with versioning info
    
    Args:
        model_path: Path to the model file or run URI
        model_name: Name to register the model under
        base_run_id: ID of the previous model run (for enhancement tracking)
        stage: Stage to register the model in (Development, Staging, Production)
        tags: Tags to apply to the registered model version
        
    Returns:
        Model version
    """
```

## 5. `find_models` method

```python
def find_models(self, 
               model_type: Optional[str] = None,
               version_type: Optional[str] = None,
               timeframe: Optional[str] = None,
               enhancement_type: Optional[str] = None,
               max_results: int = 10) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Find models matching the specified criteria with flexible filtering
    
    This method allows finding models of any type with flexible filtering options.
    It supports the full model enhancement lifecycle, allowing for finding 
    both base models and any type of enhanced models.
    
    Args:
        model_type: Type of model to find ('base', 'continued', 'curriculum', etc.) or None for any
        version_type: Version type to find ('latest' or 'old') or None for any
        timeframe: Specific timeframe to filter by or None for any/current
        enhancement_type: Type of enhancement to filter by or None for any
        max_results: Maximum number of results to return
        
    Returns:
        List of dictionaries with model information
    """
```

## Implementation Note

These documentation updates can be applied to the `MLflowManager` class to better explain the flexible 
model type system. The functionality already exists in the code, but these documentation updates make
it more explicit that the system supports enhancing any type of model, not just base models.
